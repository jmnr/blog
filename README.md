# 4 Coders. 5 Days. 1 Blog

This readme is walkthough of what 4 people had to learn to be able to build a beautiful responsive blog in less thana week.

##What we used
+ [Github](/before-arrival.md)
+ [Pivotal tracker](/before-arrival.md)
+ [Harp](/before-arrival.md)
+ [Qunit](/before-arrival.md)

[Founders and Coders](/before-arrival.md) runs 16 week programme that takes people who are relatively new to programming and guides them towards becominng full-stack web-developmers.

This repo contains what we produced at the end of our first week. The challenge for the week was to create and host a blog form scratch. On day one, we split up one of us focused on learning as much as they can about the following: 

+ [UX](/before-arrival.md)
+ [Front End Development](/before-arrival.md)
+ [Testing](/before-arrival.md)
+ [Hosting a blog with harp](/before-arrival.md)

(click on any topic for a read me of what we learned).

##Putting a Blog together

The first milestone was wireframing. We created a series of scenarios that we wanted readers to find themselves in, called user stories. The wireframes used the user stories to create the beginning of an interface deisgn we could all agree on. 

@michell and @ronan then started working on fleshing the wireframes into html and @nikki and @josh strated figuring out how to write test for the blog. 

We learnt how to think of the development process in terms of writing tests. We devise a series of tests taht we want the blog to pass, based on the user stories, and then write just enough code to pass each test. This is called test driven development. It means you write the minimum amount of code needed (to pass your tests) and it saves you a lot of time having to go back and fix thinsg when a project starts to become complicated (because you can see which tests are failing when). 

We didn't have a live blog at this point. We just wrote generic tests for a page that loads up a remote page in an iframe. Once the blog was live we could load it up and test things with relative ease.

The next step was to figure out how to host the HTML pages using harp.

I had very little to do with this and would appreciate if someone editing this to explain hwo it was done.

In summary: 
+ The process started with UX,
+ Progressed to front end work,
+ which led to thinking about the tests we wanted the blog to pass. 
+ Hosting the bloga nd then running the tests to make sure everything is ok.
