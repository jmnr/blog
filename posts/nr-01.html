        <h1>Taking the plunge</h1><h3>Nikhila Ravi | Friday 15th May 2015</h3><h4>16 strangers, 8 weeks, 1 objective: Learning to code.</h4><p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/297682547/profile-trans-1.png" alt="Me!"></p>
<p>The first week of Founders and Coders has just flown by. Turning up on Monday morning, armed with my laptop and eager to learn, I felt like I was going back to University. </p>
<p>But it couldn&#39;t have been more different. </p>
<p>There was no lecture style teaching, a lot of collaborative work and best of all no exams or competition - I love that while we work in teams of 4 on weekly projects, we were told we&#39;re &#39;actually one big team of 16&#39;.  Anything we learn we share.  It&#39;s the perfect, unjudjemental, open  environment to learn a new skill and make some friends along the way. </p>
<p>This week, each team has been working on setting up a blog using harp.js and hosted on GitHub pages. We&#39;ve covered an immense amount of information, from learning about code testing on Qunit, pair programming, wireframing and UX design, MVPs, harp.js, css selectors, python servers and lots more things en route. </p>
<p>Now time to turn my own blog from blogspot.com generic to a personality of its own. </p>
