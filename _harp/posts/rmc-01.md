#Arbitrary Cheerful Title

Day five of week one and our first project is hours from deployment! Very exciting! Josh, Michelle, Nikhi and I have been tasked with creating a dynamic and beautiful blog to detail our Founders and Coders adventures on. We are using the Harp.js framework on Github Pages and while it is hard as hell at times, it it easy to see the advantages to using Harp. Here is a picture to prove I can use markdown.

I can't believe how much we've all learned and I can't wait to knock out another seven terrifying projects.
