#This is a test post

As with the layout file, adding an underscore to the beginning of a file’s name prevents it from generating its own page, which is great for snippets of code. This convention is true for folders, too: name a folder with an underscore at the beginning, and nothing inside will be served directly. Folders with a leading underscore are a great place to store partials. I created a new folder called shared for this purpose.
