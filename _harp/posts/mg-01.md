#Day 5: Losing Touch with the Space-Time Continuum

One week into Founders & Coders, I've developed the ability to stare at a screen for hours with weird, unwavering intensity. I look down at 10:30 and look up to find it's mid-afternoon. Three hours feels like 45 minutes. Seriously. It's eerie.

Apart from losing touch with the space-time continuum, I've learned some other cool skills. The acronym "TDD" now means something to me. My Github anxiety is gradually decreasing. And I'm a CSS pro (sort of).

In my greatest triumph of the week, I figured out how to make parallax backgrounds work. If you haven't seen the homepage, go and look right now. I'll wait. That cool sliding effect? I made that! I never thought I'd happy-cry over two lines of code, but here we are.

It's the little things...
